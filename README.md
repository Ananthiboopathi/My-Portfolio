# My-Portfolio
A personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that showcases my profile, skills, projects, certificates, and contact information in an animated, interactive, and responsive layout. JavaScript is used to add smooth scrolling, animated typing effect, and interactive sections like dark/light mode and project filters.
